# Font Picker for React

**A simple, customizable font picker allowing users to preview, select and use Google Fonts on your website.**

- Simple setup
- No dependencies
- Automatic font download and generation of the required CSS selectors
- Efficient font previews (full fonts are only downloaded on selection)

_This is the React component for the [**Font Picker**](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/font-picker) library._

</p>

## Getting started

To be able to access the API, you'll need to [generate a Google Fonts API key](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey).

### 1. Setup

Install the `font-picker-react` package using NPM:

```sh
npm install font-picker-react
```

### 2. Displaying the font picker

Add the `FontPicker` component to your React code:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import FontPicker from "font-picker-react";

export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      activeFontFamily: "Open Sans",
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <FontPicker
          apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
          activeFontFamily={this.state.activeFontFamily}
          onChange={nextFont =>
            this.setState({
              activeFontFamily: nextFont.family,
            })
          }
        />
        <p className="apply-font">The font will be applied to this text.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### 3. Applying the selected font

**Add the class `"apply-font"` to all JSX elements you want to apply the selected font to.**

When the user selects a font, it will automatically be downloaded and applied to all elements with the `"apply-font"` class.

## Props

The following props can be passed to the `FontPicker` component:

- **`apiKey` (required)**: Google API key
- **`activeFontFamily` (required)**: Font that should be selected in the font picker and applied to the text. Should be stored in the component state and updated using `onChange`
- **`onChange` (required)**: Function which is executed when the user changes the active font. This function should update `activeFontFamily` in the component state
- **`pickerId`**: If you have multiple font pickers on your site, you need to give them unique IDs which must be provided as a prop and appended to the `.apply-font` class names. Example: If `pickerId="main"`, use `className="apply-font-main"`
- **`families`**: If only specific fonts shall appear in the list, specify their names in an array. Default: All font families
- **`categories`**: Array of font categories to include in the list. Possible values: `"sans-serif", "serif", "display", "handwriting", "monospace"`. Default: All categories
- **`scripts`**: Array of scripts which the fonts must include and which will be downloaded on font selection. Example: `["latin", "greek", "hebrew"]` (see [all possible values](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/font-picker/blob/master/src/shared/types.ts)). Default: `["latin"]`
- **`variants`**: Array of variants which the fonts must include and which will be downloaded on font selection. Example: `["regular", "italic", "700", "700italic"]` (see [all possible values](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/font-picker/blob/master/src/shared/types.ts)). Default: `["regular"]`
- **`limit`**: Maximum number of fonts to display in the list (the least popular fonts will be omitted). Default: `50`
- **`sort`**: Sorting attribute for the font list. Possible values: `"alphabet", "popularity"`. Default: `"alphabet"`
- **`isSearch`**: `true` | `false` When set to `true`, and the font-selector is open, it's posibble to search for a font based on it's `family-name` by typing.

_Currently, only the `activeFontFamily` and `sort` props are reactive._
